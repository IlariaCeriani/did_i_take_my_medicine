# Did I take my medicines?  
## What is this?  
This is a quite simple CRUD app I created to help my father remember how many times he took his medicines. It requires a name and a quantity (x) and it creates a simply designed list of items. Every item will have an x amount of buttons that can be colored with a touch, to help remembering. The design is very simple and the buttons are extremely big, as my father can't see very well, has big fingers and is not really familiar with technology.
